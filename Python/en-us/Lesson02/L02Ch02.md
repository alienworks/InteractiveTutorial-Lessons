Let's look at an example:

```Python
def Main(operation, args):
    nargs = len(args)

    if nargs == 0:
        print("No args")
        return 0

    elif operation == 'generateAlien':
        temp_alienName = args[0]
        temp_owner = args[1]
        if not CheckWitness(temp_owner):
            return 0
        temp_blockHeight = GetHeight()
        temp_xna = FindXna(RandomNumber(temp_blockHeight))
        temp_alien = generateAlien(temp_xna, temp_alienName, temp_blockHeight)
        return temp_alien
```

By calling `CheckWitness` using` temp_owner`, we can determine whether `temp_owner` is the person calling the smart contract,

(*Subject to change*)
It should be noted that in Python, we always throw an Exception instead of returning false, and throwing an exception also has the effect of reverting all stored changes. This ensures that there is no wrong storage change when the operation assertion fails.
It should be noted that in Python contracts, we always choose to throw an Exception instead of returning false. This is not only because it is more in line with Python's writing, but also because it can roll back the changes made to the storage area.


### Instructions:

- Added method `generateAlien` for owner's inspection. Exception information returned if the check fails.
- Add a new method called `query`. Remember to check if the id exceeds the index.
