### Constructor

We can declare an initialization function in order to execute the logic we want when the contract is deployed, because the initialization function will only be executed once (cannot be called by other exchanges).
The logic of the initialization function is to use a `flag` in the storage space to record whether it has been initialized.

```Python
def initialize():
    context = GetContext()
    ini_flag = Get(context, 'ini_flag')
    if not ini_flag:
        Put(context, 'counter', 0)
        Put(context, 'ini_flag', 1)
        Notify('Initialized')
        return 1
    else:
        return 1


def Main(operation, args):
    initialize()
```

The logic we want to implement will only be executed once, so it is the logic of the initial variable we want.

### Instructions
- In the contract, add an initialization function.
