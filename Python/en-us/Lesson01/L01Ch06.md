Functions in Python follow the following template:

```Python
def func_name(somePara):
     return value
```

- `func_name` defines the function name
- `somePara` defines the name of the input value
- `value` is the return value. If the method does not return data, it does not exist.

So far, the Alien created is just a placeholder. We want to be able to obtain a random integer and generate an XNA from that random number.

In the next chapter, we will detail how to get random numbers. Now, we need to declare a method for generating random numbers and a method for finding XNA from random numbers.

### Directive:

- Declare two methods.
- A parameter named `randomNumber`, which has a parameter named `a` of type `number` and a return value of type `number`.
- Another one named `findXna`, which has a parameter named `b` of type `number`, and the return value is of type `number`.
