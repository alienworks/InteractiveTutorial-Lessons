The last thing we need to achieve is the generation of XNA.
In the previous chapter, we simply assigned a variable-length value to `xna`. Since the number generated from the random number will be a very large integer, we will use the last 8 digits to form the XNA value.

#### Event notification

We also want to notify the client that runs the contract when a new Alien is created. In NEO, this can be achieved with `Notify`:

```Python
const notifyHello = createEventNotifier <Address> ('Hello', 'target');

export class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
   public action (target: Address) {
     notifyHello (target);
   }
}
```
The notification program itself only requires event parameters.

### Directive:

- In the `FindXna` method, return the last 8 digits of `randomNumber`.

- In the Main method, use the return value `randomNumber` to call `FindXna` and replace the assignment in the previous chapter.

- Call the notification program at the end of the `generateAlien` method.
