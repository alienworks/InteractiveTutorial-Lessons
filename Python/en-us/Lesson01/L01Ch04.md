We defined the key-value pairs that Alien has and how to add them. Now, we need a way to organize Alien collections.

#### Storage

When we want to store single information in NEO smart contract, we can like this:

```Python
ctx = GetContext()
info = Get(ctx, 'infoKey')
Put(ctx, 'infoKey', info)
```

GetContext() will return all the information stored in the smart contract.
Please note that all contract codes and storage are publicly accessible, so no data is private.

#### Structured storage

There are multiple ways to store data in Python. But as we mentioned in Chapter 3, NEO smart contracts use specific structured classes to store data.
This storage method can be roughly regarded as a dictionary type in Python, storing content in key-value pairs.

- Every element in the storage space can be accessed using its index
- Use Put to add or overwrite new key-value pairs
- Use Get to get the value corresponding to Key

```Python
context = GetContext()
Put(context, temp_alien['id'], Serialize(temp_alien))
someAlien = Deserialize(Get(context, temp_alien['id']))
```

### Next step:

Use storage space for smart contracts.

- Import Get, Put, GetContext from 'boa.interop.Neo.Storage'

- In addition to the 'generateAlien' method, store someAlien information in the contract storage space
