## Excellent!

You have completed the first lesson of the NEO Python smart contract!

With this contract, we can:

- Generate unpredictable XNA for each new Alien.
- Create an Alien object with three properties, namely: alienName, xna and blockHeight.
- Save Alien objects in smart contracts in an array format.
- Send notification whenever new Alien is generated.
- Use a familiar testing framework to test our smart contracts.
