We start off by getting acquainted with the basic template of an empty NEO Contract.
The simplest smart contract looks like:

```Python
from boa.interop.Neo.Runtime import Log, Notify

def Main():
  Notify('HelloWorld')
```


#### `Main` Function

No matter where NEO smart contract is invoked, `Main` is always the entry. Therefore, defining `Main` function's input and output is equal to defining input and output of smart contracctã€‚

In a smart contract whose input and output are int type, it's `Main` function should be defined like:

```Python
def Main(someStringInput):
  # Your function here
  return someOtherString
```

### Instructions:

- Import basic dependencies and create a contract called `AlienFinder`.

- Add a public method called `generateAlien` and let it receive and return nothing for now.
