When writing smart contract in Python, you can, for the most part, declare and use variables in the same way as in Python. There are however a few limitations [<sup>1</sup>](#1)。As we go deeper in the tutorial, we will cover more limitations.


#### Variables

Here is an example of variable initializations:

```Python
someInt = 3281
someByteArray = bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04')
someBool = True
```

`int` Definition here is same as in Python.

`byte` actually represents a fixed point number with 8 decimal places.

`bool` Have only `True` and `False`, two values.

*Unsupported*:

```Python
pi = 3.1415;
someString = int(b'\x01')
```
Float type and type coercion are **not** supported by NEO smart contract

#### String in NEO smart contract

initializations of `string` and `int` are same.

```Python
cookingMethod  = "Poached"
food = "Egg"
```

All operations related to `string`, for example：concat, get its length, slice are all supported.
Note that only ASCII code standard is supported.

For example：

```Python
combined = '1234' + '5678'    // '12345678'
len(combined)                 // 8
combined[1:5]                 // '2345'
```

### Instructions:

- Within the `generateAlien` method, declare three `number` values. The first one named `blockHeight`, the second one named `xna` and the last one named `id`.
