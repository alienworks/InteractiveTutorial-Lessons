## Bravo! 

You have completed the first lesson in NEO TypeScript smart contract! 

With this contract, we can: 

- Generate a unpredictable XNA for each new Alien. 
- Create Alien objects with three attributes: alienName, xna, and blockHeight
- Save Alien objects in the smart contract in the format of an array. 
- Notify whenever a new Alien is generated. 
- Test our smart contract with familiar test frameworks.
