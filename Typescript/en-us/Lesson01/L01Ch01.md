## Introduction

Welcome to AlienWorks! Here, you will learn to write NEO Contracts by building a game about planets, aliens and XNA. This is the TypeScript shard of our 'multiverse', and there will be more 'universes' written in other languages that can be deployed on the NEO network. 

We will start by building an "Alien Finder". It will:

- Get a random number from the current NEO blockchain
- Find a string of XNA from the random number
- Name the alien species and store it in an array

### Alien XNA (*Subject to change*)

Each alien species found will have an 8-digit integer representing its 'XNA'. Just like below: 

```
93820162
```

Every two digits correspond to an attribute of the Alien. For example, the first two digits correspond to the 'life form' of the alien. There are currently 7 types of aliens, (humanoid-0, mammalian-1, reptilian-2, insectoid-3, molluskoid-4, mechanical-5, gaseous-6). An xna information of 93 means that the alien's life form is: 

```
93 % 7 = 2
```

-- reptilian. 


> Note: other 3 attributes are currently: Strength(digits 3-4), Speed(digits 5-6), and Weight(digits 7-8)
