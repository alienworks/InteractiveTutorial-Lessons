# Block Height and Random Numbers

Our goal is to generate different and randomised XNA's each time the contract is run. To do that, we need random numbers. A random number can be acquired from the consensus data on NEO's blockchain in C#. But in TypeScript NEO smart contract, the information available from blockchain is limited.

### Blockchain Information

A block is generated on the NEO blockchain roughly every 15 seconds. It records all changes that happened on the network over the last 15 seconds. 

The 'height' of a block is the index of the order in which the block is generated. The first block has a height of 0; And the 'current height' for the network is essentially the number of blocks that have been generated before the current one.

We can write something in our contract to 'ask' the network what the current height is: 

```typescript
let blockHeight: number = Blockchain.currentHeight;
```

The `Blockchain` value contains several properties pertaining to the current state of the blockchain, the current transaction and the current invocation:

- `Blockchain.currentBlockTime` - the unix timestamp (in seconds) of the current block that this transaction will be included in.
- `Blockchain.currentHeight` - index of the last block persisted to the blockchain.
- `Blockchain.currentTransaction` - the current `InvocationTransaction`.
- `Blockchain.currentCallerContract` - if the current invocation is from another smart contract, then this value will be its address, otherwise `undefined`.

### Transaction Information

The infomation about the current InvocationTransaction from the value `currentTransaction` is very detailed.

- `hash` - the transaction `Hash256`
- `attribute` - additional features that the transaction has
- `inputs` - the source of assets
- `outputs` - the transfer results of assets
- `script` - code that was executed in NEO VM
- `unspentOutputs` - unspent outputs
- `reference` - corresponding outputs for the inputs of the transaction

For example, to get the hash of the current transaction, you can write: 

```typescript
let hash = Blockchain.currentTransaction.hash; 
```

### Random Number

For we can not access the consensus data on NEO's blockchain for now, we have to generate a random number by ourselves.

In original TypeScript we can get a random number between 0 and 1 in this way:

```typescript
let rand = Math.random(); 
```

But on blockchain, any independent calculations of the same function and the same parameters should get the same result. In other word, blockchain does not allow randomness.

So the actual 'random' number for blockchain is not really random but unpredictable.

To get such a 'random' number, we should use some unpredictable data from the blockchain.

## Instructions

- In the `generateAlien` method, get the current height from the blockchain and assign it to the variable `blockHeight`.
- In the `RandomNumber` method, multiple the value `blockHeight` with the current block time, and return the result as a random number. 
- In the `generateAlien` method, make a call to the `RandomNumber` method, with `blockHeight` as its argument, and assign the result to `xna` for now.
- In the `generateAlien` method, use the counter to generate the ids of aliens, which starts from `1`. And assign it to the variable `id`.
