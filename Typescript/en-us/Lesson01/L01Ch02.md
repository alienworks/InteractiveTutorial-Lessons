When writing NEO contracts in TypeScript, you can, for the most part, declare and use variables in the same way as in TypeScript. There are however a few limitations. 

As we go deeper in the tutorial, we will cover more limitations. But for now, the first limitation regarding basic variable types is that floating numbers can **not** be defined as `number` in NEO contracts. 

#### Number and Fixed<8>

Here is an example of variable initializations: 

```typescript
let int: number = 3281;
let float: Fixed<8> = 8_00000000;
```

Here we use the `number` type to represent interger, and the `Fixed` type to keep the value `8.00000000`. 

All numbers in a NEO smart contract must be integers (up to 256 bits, to be precise), so typically we use an integer multiplied by a power of 10 to represent decimals. In this case, `Fixed<8>` is telling the compiler that this number actually represents a fixed point number with 8 decimal places.

So here `float` is actually a `BigNumber` with the value of 8. This type has no impact on how the smart contract executes, but it does change how the automatically generated NEO client APIs function.


#### String in NEO Contracts

You can declare `string` in the same way that you can with `number`. 

```typescript
let cookingMethod: string = 'Poached'; 
let food: string = 'Egg'; 
```

And all basic operations with `string` are also available.

```typescript
let combined = cookingMethod + ' ' + food;  // "Poached Egg"
let length = cookingMethod.length;          // 7
let subString = cookingMethod.substring(2); // "ached"
let subString2 = cookingMethod.substring(2,3); // "ach"
```

#### Array

Arrays store multiple variables of the same type in one reference. Its general form looks like this: 

```typescript
let arrayName: type[]; 
```

The type of an array can be value types such as `number` and `boolean`, or an object: 

```typescript
let integers: number[] = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; 
let weekDays: string[] = [ "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri" ]; 
let aliens: Alien[];  //Lets define the Alien later
```

You can access or change array members like this: 

```typescript
console.log(integers[0]);  // "1"
integers[0] = 3; 
console.log(ingeters[0]);  // "3"

console.log(aliens[0].alienName);
```

Arrays are actually objects, which means, you can declare arrays with the `new` keyword: 

```typescript
let integers: number[] = new Array( 1, 2, 3 ); 
```

It also means each array has multiple fields that can be called. The most common one being `length`: 

```typescript
let names: string[] = new Array(4); 
console.log(names.length); // "4"
```

### Instructions: 

- Within the `generateAlien` method, declare three `number` values. The first one named `blockHeight`, the second one named `xna` and the last one named `id`. (We will learn more about block height in Chapter 6)
- Add a input parameter in the format of string called `alienName` to the `generateAlien` method.
- Add a private counter for the contract, which has an initial value `0`.
