We start off by getting acquainted with the basic template of an empty NEO Contract:

```typescript
import { SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';

export class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```
#### Class and extention

Every NEO smart contract starts with a TypeScript source file that exports a single class extending SmartContract.

The simplest smart contract looks like: 

```typescript
export class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

And all values that are not global can be imported from `@neo-one/smart-contract`:

```typescript
import { SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';
```

This package contains all of the NEO smart contract types and is where the majority of imports will come from. `SmartContract` is a basic class that when extended marks the class as a NEO smart contract, and we will import more dependencies in the future.


### Instructions: 

- Import basic dependencies and create a contract called `AlienFinder`.

- Add a public method called `generateAlien` and let it receive and return nothing for now.
