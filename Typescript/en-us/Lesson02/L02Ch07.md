## Bravo! 

You have completed the second lesson in NEO TypeScript smart contract! 

With this contract, we can now: 

- Declare the ownership with a constructor.
- Secure our contract with a simple authentication. 
- Throw an error if something goes wrong.
- Use switches to mutate an Alien randomly. 
- Test our new methods with a configurable network.
