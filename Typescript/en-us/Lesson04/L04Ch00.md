## Lesson 03: Aliens as Token

We have complete a DnD adventure game in our Alien World. This random game is driven by several dices, such as D6, D10 and D100. As far as we know, an alien which has a high xna is also rare to collect. It's a good choice to upgrade our game to a collection game. By allowing a trade, our aliens will become tokens and have their values for rarity. This lesson introduces the NEP-5 and NEP-11  in NEO economy.

By the end, our Aliens will be able to be traded in a standard way!
