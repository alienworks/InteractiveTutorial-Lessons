### NEP-5

If you've been in the NEO space for any amount of time, you probably know about [NEP-5](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki) tokens. NEP-5 is a token standard for the NEO blockchain that will provide systems with a generalized interaction mechanism for tokenized Smart Contracts. 

In a NEP-5 token's contract, these methods are required,

- `name()` - returns the name of the token. e.g. "MyToken".
- `symbol()` - returns a short string symbol of the token managed in this contract. e.g. "MYT".
- `decimals()` - returns the number of decimals used by the token - e.g. 8, means to divide the token amount by 100,000,000 to get its user representation.
- `totalSupply()` - returns the total token supply deployed in the system.
- `balanceOf()` - returns the token balance of the account.
- `transfer()` - transfers an amount of tokens from the from account to the to account.

And a related event is also necessary,

- `transfer()` - notify the invocation of the method which has the same name.

A python example is avaliable [here](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-boa/blob/master/boa_test/example/demo/NEP5.py).

In a TypeScript smart contract, the method `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()` will be automatically generated if we declare some properties with the same name.

## Instructions

- According to the NEP-5 requirement, declare these methods and events in our `AlienFinder`.
- Give proper inputs and return types to these methods in a TypeScript style.
