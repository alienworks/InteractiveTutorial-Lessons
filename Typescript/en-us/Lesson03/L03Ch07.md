# Bravo! 

You have completed the third lesson in NEO TypeScript smart contract! 

With this contract, we can now: 

- Use random number to simulate different dices.
- Increase or decrease the Alien's xna as reward and punishment
- Define several game events and judge the result in a random but reasonable way.
- Allow our Aliens to step forward and make their adventures.
