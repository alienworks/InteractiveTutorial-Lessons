# Lesson 03: Dice-Based Adventure System

We have built the foundations of our Alien World. Now it is time to implement the game logic. This lesson focuses on the game design, so there are fewer knowledge points than Lesson 01 and Lesson 02. But don't worry, it is much more interesting.

By the end, we will get a well-integrated DnD adventure game based on NEO smart contract!
