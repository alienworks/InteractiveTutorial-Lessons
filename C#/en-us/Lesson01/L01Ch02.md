When writing NEO contracts in C#, you can, for the most part, declare and use variables in the same way as in C#. There are however a few limitations[<sup>1</sup>](#1). As we go deeper in the tutorial, we will touch on these limitations. 

#### Variables

Here is an example of some supported variable declarations: 

```c#
uint unsignedInt = 3281;
ulong unsignedLong = 847282; 
byte b = 23; 
bool condition = true; 
```

`uint` is a 32-bit unsinged integer with value ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295. It can also be declared as `uint32`

`ulong` is a 64-bit unsigned integer with value ranging from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. It can also be declared as `uint64`

`byte` is an 8-bit unsigned integer with value ranging from 0 to 255. It is the smallest unit of integer type. 

`bool` is a boolean value, which can either be `true` or `false`. 


*Unsupported Variables*: 

```c#
float a = 3.1415;
double b = 6.0221;
decimal c = 6.6261; 
```
`float` `double` `decimal` are all floating point variables, and they are **not** supported natively in NEO Contracts. There are other ways to represent these data types in NEO, which we will cover later in the tutorial. 


#### String in NEO Contracts

You can declare `string`s in the same way that you can with `uint`. 

```c#
string cookingMethod  = "Poached"; 
string food = "Egg"; 
```

And all basic operations with `string`s such as concatenation, fetch length and taking substrings is supported for ASCII characters only. 

Examples: 

```c#
string combined = cookingMethod + " " + food;  // "Steamed Ham"
string combined2 = $"{cookingMethod} {food}"; //"Steamed Ham"
int length = cookingMethod.Length;          // 7
string subString = cookingMethod.Substring(2); // "ached"
string subString2 = cookingMethod.Substring(2,3); // "ach"
```

### Instructions: 

- Within the Main method, declare two `uint` values. One named `blockHeight` and the other one named `xna`. (We will learn more about block height in Chapter 7)
