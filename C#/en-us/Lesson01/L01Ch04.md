# Constructors
> *Tag: Beginner*

After defining the Alien class, we can specify how each instance of Alien is created by defining a constructor. 

Below is an example of a constructor. 

```c#
public class Point
{
    public static int counter; 
    public int x;
    public int y;
    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

`public Point(int x, int y) {...}` is the constructor for new 'Points'. It takes two int parameters and creates a 'Point', whose x is equal to the first parameter, and y equal to the second. 

With the above class definition, we can create a new 'Point' like this: 

```c#
var p1 = new Point(3, 5);
Point p2 = new Point(4, 6); // specifies the type of p2
```

### Default Constructor

If `Point` does not have a constructor definition (as shown below), it would have a default constructor, which has no parameters. 
```c#
public class Point
{
    public static int counter; 
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

var p2 = new Point(); 
```
This creates an object where each field's data is their default value. (`0`, `null` or `false`. Base on what the type is)

Importantly, if the data inside the class is public, you can pass in arguments like this: 

```c#
var p2 = new Point
{
    x = 4,
    y = 6
}; 
```
This is a common practice for simple classes with public fields. 

### More on Static Fields

Here is an example making use of the point class. 
*(`Console.WriteLine()` simply writes the data in the bracket as an output)*

```c#
var p1 = new Point(2,4); 
var p2 = new Point(3,5); 
p1.counter = 1; 
Console.WriteLine(p1.counter);  //"1"

p2.x = 7; 
Console.WriteLine(p2.x); //"7"
Console.WriteLine(p1.x); //"2"

p2.counter = 2; 
Console.WriteLine(p1.counter); //"2"
```

Since the static field `counter` belongs to the class instead of any individual object, its changes will reflect no matter which object calls the field. 

We can use this nature of static fields to implement a counter that keeps track of how many instances have been created. 

## Instructions: 

- In the Main method, declare a `Alien` type called `someAlien`, call the *default constructor*, and pass in some random values into the object.
