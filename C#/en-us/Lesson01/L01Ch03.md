# Classes, the Basics
> *Tag: Beginner*

Now we need a data type that encapsulates the attributes of each Alien, and this is where classes come in. A class is a 'blueprint' for a type of object. It can have multiple variables of different data types, it can also have custom defined behaviours (methods, which we will cover later). 

For now, we will focus on classes that simply have multiple variables. 

Here is an example of a simple class: 

```c#
public class Point
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
```

The code above defines a new type of class called 'Point'. Here, each instance of 'Point' has two int fields: x-corrdinate and y-coordinate. 

One can intialize an object of class `Point`, and modify its fields: 

```c#
Point p = new Point(); 
p.x = 5; 
p.y = 6; 
```

The `public` keyword in front of `x` and `y` is an access modifier. It means any code can access and modify these variables. A `private` modifier makes a field only accessible by code in the same class. 

### Static Fields

Each field in a class can optionally be `static`. 

```c#
public class Point
{
    public static int counter; 
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
```

Static fields belong to the class itself, not objects/instances of the class. For example, `x` and `y` can be seen as variable of each `Point` object, but `counter` is a variable that belongs to the `Point` class, not any specific object. See chapter 4 for more on static fields. 

## Instructions: 

Define an Alien class that includes the three attributes we need for each 'Alien species': xna, name, and the block it was found on. 

- Define a class called Alien
- Declare a public static field called `counter`, of type `uint`. Initiate its value (0); 
- Declare three none-static `public` fields: a `uint` named `xna`, a `string` named `alienName`, and a `uint` named `id`.
