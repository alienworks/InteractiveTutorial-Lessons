# Lesson 4: Aliens as Tokens

We have completed a simple adventure game based on different 'dices'. As far as we know, an alien with a high XNA is more likely to succeed in the adventure game, but is also rare to colect. Aliens with certain outfit combinations may also become more popular. This makes certain combinations of XNA more sought after than others. 

By treating each alien as a tradable 'token' that has ownership, we can implement a collection component to our game. The process of implementing tokens will introduce you two basic token standards in the NEO network: NEP-5 and NEP-11. 

By the end, our Aliens will be able to be traded in a standard way!
