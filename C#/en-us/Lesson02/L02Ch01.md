# More on Classes
> *Tag: Beginner*

## Getters and Setters

A class can hold many things, including variables and methods. One of the most common methods for accessing class variables are 'getters' and 'setters'. 

Example: 

```c#
class Square {
    private int area;

    public int GetArea() 
    { return this.area; }

    public int SetArea(int area)
    { this.area = area; }
}
```

With these methods, the `area` attribute can be accessed like follows: 
```c#
Square s = new Square(); 
int area = s.GetArea(); 
s.SetArea(0); 
```

The point of these additional methods is to to define specific rules for accessing or changing the data in an object. You may have noticed that the `area` variable is defined as `private`, which means `area` can only be accessed using the `GetArea` method, and changed using `SetArea`. If we now wish to limit the area of this square to within 400, we could write: 

```c#
...
    public int SetArea(int area)
    { 
        if (area > 400) { this.area = 400; } 
        else { this.area = area; }    
    }
...
```

## Class Properties

Getter and setter methods are very common in class definitions, and C# has shortcuts for declaring these methods. 

The above getters and setters can be written as: 

```c#
    class Square {
    private int area;

    public int Area
    {
        public get { return area; }
        public set { area = value; }
    }
}
```

There is a further shortcut if we simply wish to get and set the `area ` variable without any addditional rules. They can be written as: 

```c#
class Square 
{
    public int Area
    { get; set; }
}
```
This is the equivalent of declaring public getters and setters. 

Also remember that when we declare `Area`, the variable declaration for `area` is not needed. In these cases, `Area` is also referred to as a ***property*** of Square objects. They can be accessed like this: 

```c#
Square s = new Square(); 
int area = s.Area; 
```

We can also add access modifiers to properties: 

```c#
class Square {
    public int Area
    { get; private set; }
}
```
Our goal is to add some properties for the Alien class. 

## BigInteger 

`BigInteger` is a special type of data that can represent ingeters. It is a struct, which can encapsulate multiple variables. `BigInteger` can be declared and initialised like below: 

*Note that struct is a value type, not a reference type.*

```c#
BigInteger big1 = new BigInteger(10000000); 
BigInteger big2 = 10000000; 
ulong l = 1000000000; 
BigInteger fromULong = l; 
```

Other integer types can be implicitly cast as `BigInteger`s. 

This data type has built-in functions to convert to and from `byte[]`, it will come in handy when we start dealing with storage later in this lesson. 

## Instructions

1. In `Alien` class, change the variables to public *properties* `uint Xna`, `string AlienName`, `BigInteger Id`.  Give all three getters and setters; 
2. Update the arguments for aliens in `main()` to refer to properties
