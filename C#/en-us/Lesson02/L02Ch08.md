Because NEO Virtual Machine is more compact than .Net, NEO's C# compiler only supports a limited number of variables from C#. Considering the large scope of features in C#, it is helpful to take a white-list approach, and look at the basic types that are fully supported by the compiler: 

- ByteArray
- Integer
- Boolean
- Array
- Struct
- Map
- Interface

Some other commonly used types are implemented through one of the above types, for example: 
- All integral types (`int`, `uint`, `ulong`, ...) are implemented as `BigInteger` from `System.Numerics`, and are fully supported
- `string` is implemented in NEO VM as its UTF8 ByteArray, which means it does not support the string handlers native to .Net
- `char` is implemented as integer

See [this page]((https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/write/limitation.html)) for a detailed account on supported types and limitations. 

### Built-in Types

The NEO library also has a few built-in types to address the lack of a some C# types. 

- [BigDecimal](https://docs.neo.org/developerguide/en/api/Neo.BigDecimal.html) is a custom struct that can be used to define a decimal number. It can be used in place of float point numbers. 

- [Map](https://docs.neo.org/developerguide/en/api/Neo.VM.Types.Map.html) is a custom class used for key-value dictionaries.
