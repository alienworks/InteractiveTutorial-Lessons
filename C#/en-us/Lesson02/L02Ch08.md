# Well Done! 

Our AlienFinder is becoming more and more functional. Now it is capable of 
- Different function calls depending on the first parameter
- Counting the number of aliens created and assigning a unique ID to each
- Read/write data with the blockchain
- Raising Exceptions
- Query specific Aliens. 
  
In the next chapter, we will be implementing a few game mechanics for our aliens, so that they can encounter adventures, and receive either boom or harm from it.
