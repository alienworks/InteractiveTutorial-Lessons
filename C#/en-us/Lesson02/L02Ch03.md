# Flow Control & Contract Structure

As we have seen in Lesson 1, Chapter 9, a contract on the Neo network functions as a list of methods that can be called by other programs or clients. A common practice is to use the main method as the entry point, and use the first parameter for users to specify which method they want to call. Below is an example of the main method for a DNS smart contract. 

```c#
public static object Main (string method, params object[] args) {
    switch (method) {
    case "query":
            return Query ((string) args[0]);
    case "register":
            return Register ((string) args[0], (byte[]) args[1]);
    case "delete":
            return Delete ((string) args[0]);
    default:
            return false;
    }
}
```

Aside from the first parameter, which takes a string variable, the main methods takes an array of objects as parameters, which get cast into specified data types at method calls. 

Note that `byte[]` is the most commonly used data type for verifying account and encryption. In the case of `Register ()`, the `args[1]` parameter is the address of an account. 

The main method uses a `switch-case` statement to cycle through method calls, and returns a boolean value of false if no matching statement is found. 

## Instructions

- Create a public, static, `GenerateAlien ()` method. Its return type is `BigInteger`. Its first parameter is a string called `alienName`. Second parameter is `byte[]` called owner. 
- Move the body of `Main ()` to the new GenerateAlien () method. 
- Add `return 1;` at the end of the method. This is a placeholder. 
- Use `switch` statement to check the value of `method` variable. 
  - In the case that it is `generateAlien`, return a call to `GenerateAlien` method. 
  - In the default case, return false. 
  - In the method call, cast the first argument as `string`, cast the second argument as `byte[]`
