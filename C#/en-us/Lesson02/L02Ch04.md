# Exceptions & Runtime Class

Since any data can be passed into our method call, we want our `GenerateAlien()` method to be able to handle unexpected parameters, and verify that whoever is calling the contract is authorised. 

### Throwing Exceptions

Exception objects are sometimes thrown when unexpected parameters are passed into the contract. This gives developers more feedback and enables them to use `try-catch` statements to handle the exceptions in their code. An example of throwing an exceptions can be as follows: 

```c#
throw new System.ArgumentException("Parameter cannot be null"); 
```

Exceptions are supported in Neo contracts. 

### Neo.Runtime Class

[Runtime](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/reference/scapi/fw/dotnet/neo/Runtime.html#method) class inside the NEO smart contract framework is a very useful class for obtaining information about the contract during the current execution. We have previously used the `Notify()` method of the class. 

It has the following attributes: 
- `Time` gets the time stamp of the current block
- `Trigger` gets the trigger type for the current contract call. 

And the following methods
- `CheckWitness(byte[] AddrOrPubkey)` checks that the `AddrOrPubkey` is the address or public key of the same account that is currently calling this contract. 
- `Log(string)` sends a log message to the client executing the contract. 
- `Notify(params object[])` raises a notification event to the client executing the contract. 

### Trigger types

A contract on the Neo network is most often called using a `Verification` trigger or an `Application` trigger. 

A `Verification` trigger can accept multiple parameters and return a boolean value. It is used in the network to determine whether a transaction is valid. A contract that handles these triggers may look like this: 

```c#
public static bool Main(byte[] signature)
{
    if (Runtime.Trigger == TriggerType.Verification)
    {
        if (/*condition*/)
                return true;
            else
                return false;
    }  
}
```

Note that `TriggerType` is a built-in `enum` type in NEO services. `Verification` is a field inside this `enum` type with value `0`.

An `Application` trigger calls the contract as a function, can accept multiple parameters, change the state of the blockchain, and return values any type. 

Since our contract is a collection of functions, we will be solely concerned with dealing with `Application` triggers. 


## Instructions

1. In the main method, check if runtime trigger type is 'application'. If it is, run the switch statement. If not, return false. 
2. In the `GenerateAlien()` method, check if variable `owner` is the desired length(20 or 33). If it equals to neither, raise an InvalidOperationException with the message: "The parameter owner should be a 20-byte address or a 33-byte public key"
3. In the same method, use `CheckWitness` to check the validity of `owner`. If the check fails, return false. This ensures that the wallet that calls the method can only generate aliens for itself.
