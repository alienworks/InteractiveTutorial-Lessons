# Well Done! 

You have completed the third lesson in NEO TypeScript smart contract! 

With this contract, we can now: 

- Use random number to simulate different dices.
- Increase or decrease the Alien's xna as reward and punishment.
- Use dice roll to determine the result of an action.
- Allow our Aliens to step forward and have random encounters.
