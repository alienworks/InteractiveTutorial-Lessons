# Lesson 3: Dice-Based Adventure System

With this chapter, we will implement the core functions of the game, in which the alien triggers random encounters, and determines, depending on the 'dice roll', whether it will be rewarded or punished by the encounter. We will encounter the use of delegats and events, learn to use built-in delegates and define custom events. 

By the end, we will get a well-integrated DnD adventure game based on NEO smart contract!
