# Events, Continued
> *Tag: C# Basics*

### Null Check

When a delegate/event is invoked, it is possible that it does not point to any method. In those cases, a `NullReferenceException` is thrown. It is therefore a good practice to wrap event invocations around an if statement: 

```c#
if (SomeEvent != null) SomeEvent(param1, param2); 
```

Now, `SomeEvent` will only be invoked when it contains reference to methods. 

### Built-in Delegates

C# also provdes built-in delegates for simple parameter signatures. For example, `Action<T1, T2>` delegate can refer to any method of two parameters and returns `void`. So instead of:

```c#
delegate void SomeDele(string s1, string s2); 
event SomeDele SomeEvent; 
```

One can define `SomeEvent` like this: 

```c#
event Action<string, string> SomeEvent. 
```

## Instructions
   
1. Create two public `static` events, `Rewarded` and `Punished`, which both have `Action<string, uint>` as their signature delegate. 

2. Create a public `static` event, `EncounterTriggered`, whose signature delegate is `Action` with a `string` and a `byte[]` as its parameters. 

3. In each of the five methods, use a null check to call the corresponding event. For example, for `OnAlienGenerated()`, the null check should be: 
    ```c#
    if (AlienGenerated != null) AlienGenerated(id); 
    ```

4. Change the event invocations in GenerateAlien and Delete into calls of methods written in (3)
