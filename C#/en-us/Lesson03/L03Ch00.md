# Lesson 03: Implementing Game Mechanics

With this chapter, we will implement the core function of `Forward()`, in which the alien triggers random encounters, and determines, depending on the 'dice roll', whether it will be rewarded or punished by the encounter. 

We will encounter the use of delegats and events, learn to define custom events and use built-in delegates. 

Aside from Events, chapter does not touch on many aspects specific to NEO contract programming itself, so readers adept with C# programming may wish to proceed to Lesson 4.
