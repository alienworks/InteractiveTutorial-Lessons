To lay the groundwork of game mechanics, we want to implement some methods that will come in handy later. The goal is to have `D6 ()`, `D10 ()`, `D100 ()` methods that behave similarly to 6-soded, 10-sided and 100-sided dices of the same name. 

- D6 returns a random `uint` between 0 and 5. 
- D10 returns a random `uint` between 0 and 9. 
- D100 returns a random `uint` between 0 and 99. 
- DN(n) returns a `BigInteger` between 1 and n. This method will be used to randomly select an alien id. 

Additionally, `getStrength ()`, `getSpeed`, `getWeight` should return the corresponding two digits in the xna. Recall from Lesson1 that an xna has 8 digits. The 3 attributes are: Strength(digits 3-4), Speed(digits 5-6), and Weight(digits 7-8). 

One thing to note is the return type of these methods. For example, since `RandomNumber ()` returns a `ulong`, an explicit casting is required for methods with a return type of `uint`. 

## Instructions: 
1. Implement `D6 ()`, `D10 ()`, `D100 ()` such that they return a number between 0 and n-1. Apply casting when appropriate. 
2. Implement `DN (BigInteger n)` such that they return a number *between 1 and n*. 
3. Implement `getStrength ()`, `getSpeed ()`, `getWeight ()` using `%` and `/`.
