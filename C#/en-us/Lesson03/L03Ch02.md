## Instructions: 
1. Create a custom delegate called `deleAlienEvent` with `void` return type and one parameter of type `BigInteger`. 
2. Create events called `AlienGenerated` and `AlienDeleted` whose signature delegate are `deleAlienEvent`
3. Create an event called `AlienDeleted` with signature delegate as `deleAlienEvent`
4. Replace `Runtime.Notify()` call in GenerateAlien() with the event `AlienGenerated`. Pass in the alien id as parameter. 
5. In `Delete()`, raise event `AlienDeleted()`, pass in id as parameter. (use conversion method when needed)
